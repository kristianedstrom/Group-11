## BIM Execution Plan (BEP)

**Project:** Building Cost Calculation

**Client:** [Your Name]

**Date:** 2023-11-06

**1. Project Overview**

This project involves developing a BIM use case to calculate the total price of the building, as well as the costs for each separate component of the structure. The use case will be implemented using Python and IfcOpenShell.

**2. BIM Roles and Responsibilities**

The following BIM roles and responsibilities have been defined for this project:

* **Developer:** Responsible for developing the Python script to calculate the building cost.
* **BIM Manager:** Responsible for coordinating the BIM process and ensuring compliance with the BEP.
* **Quantity Surveyor:** Responsible for providing quantity and cost data for the building elements.

**3. BIM Software**

The following BIM software will be used for this project:

* IfcOpenShell
* Python

**4. BIM Process**

The following BIM process will be followed for this project:

1. **Requirements Gathering:** The developer and BIM manager will meet with the quantity surveyor to gather the requirements for the use case.
2. **Use Case Development:** The developer will develop the Python script to calculate the building cost.
3. **Use Case Testing:** The BIM manager and quantity surveyor will test the use case to ensure that it is working correctly.
4. **Use Case Deployment:** The developer will deploy the use case to the BIM team.

**5. BIM Deliverables**

The following BIM deliverables will be produced for this project:

* Python script to calculate the building cost
* User documentation for the Python script

**6. BIM Standards**

The following BIM standards will be followed for this project:

* ISO 19650

**7. BIM Schedule**

The following BIM schedule has been developed for this project:

| Task | Start Date | End Date |
|---|---|---|
| Requirements Gathering | 2023-11-07 | 2023-11-09 |
| Use Case Development | 2023-11-10 | 2023-11-14 |
| Use Case Testing | 2023-11-15 | 2023-11-16 |
| Use Case Deployment | 2023-11-17 | 2023-11-18 |

**8. BIM Communication Plan**

The following BIM communication plan has been developed for this project:

* Weekly BIM coordination meetings will be held to discuss the project progress and any issues.
* The BIM manager will be responsible for communicating with the client and other stakeholders on the project status.

**9. BIM Risk Management Plan**

The following BIM risk management plan has been developed for this project:

| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|---|---|---|
| Inaccurate input data | The BIM manager will review the input data for accuracy before it is used in the use case.
| Script errors | The developer will thoroughly test the script to identify and fix any errors.
| Communication delays | Weekly BIM coordination meetings will be held and the BIM manager will be responsible for communicating with the client and other stakeholders on the project status.

**10. BIM Change Management Plan**

Any changes to the project scope or schedule will be communicated to the BIM manager and approved by the client before being implemented.

**11. BIM Closeout Plan**

Once the project is complete, the BIM manager will archive the project files for future reference.
