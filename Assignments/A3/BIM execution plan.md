## BIM Execution Plan: Calculate Building Costs

### 1. Introduction

**Objectives:**

* Introduce the construction project and the importance of cost estimation within the BIM framework.
* Emphasize alignment with ISO 19650 for information management.

### 2. Project Information

**Project Scope:**

* Provide a detailed description of the project's scope, goals, and the importance of cost calculation.
* Reference the ISO 19650 requirements for managing information for the project.

### 3. BIM Use Case: Calculate Building Costs

**Description:**

* Define the specific use case: accurate calculation of the total building cost and costs associated with individual components.
* Emphasize ISO 19650's principles of data management and information delivery.

### 4. Roles and Responsibilities

**Stakeholders:**

* Identify key stakeholders and their roles based on ISO 19650, including the project manager, cost consultant, BIM manager, and other relevant parties.
* Clarify roles, responsibilities, and contributions to information management and cost estimation.

### 5. Standards and Procedures

**ISO 19650 Alignment:**

* Integrate ISO 19650's information management principles into the BIM execution for cost calculation.
* Establish standards for managing the IFC model and property sets, ensuring compliance with ISO 19650.

### 6. Software and Tools

**ISO 19650-2 Compliance:**

* Select BIM software aligned with ISO 19650-2 standards, such as Autodesk Revit, Bentley Systems AECOsim Building Designer, or Trimble Connect.
* Use tools compliant with ISO 19650 for accurate quantity takeoff and cost estimation.

### 7. Data Management

**ISO 19650 Data Protocols:**

* Implement protocols for managing the IFC model and property sets based on ISO 19650 requirements.
* Use information exchange formats and version control in line with ISO 19650 standards.

### 8. Implementation and Execution Plan

**Workflow and Information Delivery:**

* Develop a detailed execution plan following ISO 19650's structure for information delivery.
* Include checkpoints and review processes to ensure adherence to ISO 19650's information management requirements.

### 9. Quality Control

**Validation and Assurance:**

* Use methods for validating data accuracy in alignment with ISO 19650.
* Implement quality assurance measures based on ISO 19650 principles for reliable cost calculations.

### 10. Collaboration and Coordination

**Communication Framework:**

* Establish communication and collaboration protocols compliant with ISO 19650 standards.
* Use a communication platform that is compliant with ISO 19650 standards, such as Autodesk BIM 360 or Bentley Systems ProjectWise.

### 11. Pre-Conditions and Input Data

**Compliance Requirements:**

* Ensure that all ISO 19650 prerequisites are met for successful execution, such as a complete and accurate IFC model and property sets.
* Emphasize the importance of adhering to ISO 19650 standards for data accuracy and completeness.

### 12. Dependencies and Post-Use Case Actions

**Information Utilization:**

* Identify other use cases that can benefit from the calculated cost data, maintaining ISO 19650 compliance.
* Provide guidelines for utilizing cost data in subsequent project phases, aligned with ISO 19650's lifecycle management.
